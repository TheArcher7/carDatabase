A simple database system in Java

Created 9/9/2023 by TheArcher7
This is a database setup that uses Java code to interract with a csv file.
Currently I am taking a class about Software Engineering 1, and databases was touched upon briefly. 
The class was about creating UML diagrams to best model the databases, and be able to translate the data in objects into relational tables.
I am looking forward to comparing the diagram of the practical implementation to the diagrams I can create in planning.
At the time, I do not have any practical experience with SQL, so I instead did some file reading/writing to flex my basic skills.
The code took 3 hours to write. I started with the idea that I would read and write to the file for every database function: create, read, update, and delete
However, I realized that I could read the data from the csv file into an arraylist and perform the functions on that, then use a save() method to rewrite the data to the file.
Thanks.
